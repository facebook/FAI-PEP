# Facebook AI Performance Evaluation Platform

Facebook AI Performance Evaluation Platform is a framework and backend agnostic benchmarking platform to compare machine learning inferencing runtime metrics on a set of models and on variety of backends. It also provides a means to check performance regressions on each commit. It is licensed under Apache License 2.0. Please refer to the [LICENSE](/LICENSE) file for details.

Currently, the following performance metrics are collected:

* Delay : the latency of running the entire network and/or the delay of running each individual operator.
* Error : the error between the values of the outputs running a model and the golden outputs.
* Energy/Power : the energy per inference and average power of running the ML model on a phone without battery.
* Other User Provided Metrics : the harness can accept any metric that the user binary generates.

## Framework and backend agnostic benchmarking platforms

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving area with many moving parts: new and existing framework enhancements, new hardware solutions, new software backends, and new models. With so many moving parts, it is very difficult to quickly evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. However, such evaluation is vastly important in guiding resource allocation in:

* the development of the frameworks
* the optimization of the software backends
* the selection of the hardware solutions
* the iteration of the machine learning models

This project aims to achieve the two following goals:

* Easily evaluate the runtime performance of a model selected to be benchmarked on all existing backends.
* Easily evaluate the runtime performance of a backend selected to be benchmarked on all existing models.

The flow of benchmarking is illustrated in the following figure:

![Benchmarking flow](/flow.png)

The flow is composed of three parts:

* A centralized model/benchmark specification
  * A fair input to the comparison
* A centralized benchmark driver with distributed benchmark execution
  * The same code base for all backends to reduce variation
  * Distributed execution due to the unique build/run environment for each backend
* A centralized data consumption
  * One stop to compare the performance

The currently supported frameworks are: Caffe2, TFLite

The currently supported model formats are: Caffe2, TFLite

The currently supported backends: CPU, GPU, DSP, Android, iOS, Linux based systems

The currently supported libraries: Eigen, MKL, NNPACK, OpenGL, CUDA

## Performance regression detection

The benchmark platform also provides a means to compare performance between commits and detect regressions. It uses an A/B testing methodology that compares the runtime difference between a newer commit (treatment) and an older commit (control). The metric of interest is the relative performance difference between the commits, as the backend platform's condition may be different at different times. Running the same tests on two different commit points at the same time removes most of the variations of the backend. This method has been shown to improve the precision of detecting performance regressions.

## Directory structure

The benchmarking codebase resides in `benchmarking` directory. Inside, the `frameworks` directory contains all supported ML frameworks. A new framework can be added by creating a new directory, deriving from `framework_base.py`, and implementing all its methods. The `platforms` directory contains all supported ML backend platforms. A new backend can be added by creating a new directory, deriving from `platform_base.py`, and implementing all its methods.

The model specifications resides in `specifications` directory. Inside, the `models` directory contains all model and benchmarking specifications organized in model format. The `benchmarks` directory contains a sequence of benchmarks organized in model format. The `frameworks` directory contains custom build scripts for each framework.

## Model/Benchmark specification
The models and benchmarks are specified in json format. It is best to use the example in `/specifications/models/caffe2/squeezenet/squeezenet.json` as an example to understand what data is specified.

A few key items in the specifications

* The models are hosted in third party storage. The download links and their MD5 hashes are specified. The benchmarking tool automatically downloads the model if not found in the local model cache. The MD5 hash of the cached model is computed and compared with the specified one. If they do not match, the model is downloaded again and the MD5 hash is recomputed. This way, if the model is changed, only need to update the specification and the new model is downloaded automatically.
* In the `inputs` field of `tests`, one may specify multiple shapes. This is a short hand to indicate that we benchmark the tests of all shapes in sequence.
* In some field, such as `identifier`, you may find some string like `{ID}`. This is a placeholder to be replaced by the benchmarking tool to differentiate multiple test runs specified in one test specification, as in the above item.

## Run benchmark
To run the benchmark, you need to run `run_bench.py`, given a model meta data or a benchmark meta data. An example of the command is the following (when running under FAI-PEP directory):
```
benchmarking/run_bench.py -b specifications/models/caffe2/shufflenet/shufflenet.json
```
When you run the command for the first time, you are asked several questions. The answers to those questions, together with other sensible defaults, are saved in a config file: `~/.aibench/git/config.txt`. You can edit the file to update your default arguments.

The arguments to the driver are as follows. It also takes arguments specified in the following sections and pass them to those scripts.
```
usage: run_bench.py [-h] [--reset_options]

Perform one benchmark run

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --reset_options  Reset all the options that is saved by default.
```

`run_bench.py` can be the single point of entry for both interactive and regression benchmark runs.

## Stand alone benchmark run
The `harness.py` is the entry point for one benchmark run. It collects the runtime for an entire net and/or individual operator, and saves the data locally or pushes to a remote server. The usage of the script is as follows:

```
usage: harness.py [-h] [--android_dir ANDROID_DIR] [--ios_dir IOS_DIR]

## Continuous benchmark run
The `repo_driver.py` is the entry point to run the benchmark continuously. It repeatedly pulls the framework from github, builds the framework, and launches the `harness.py` with the built benchmarking binaries

The accepted arguments are as follows:

```
usage: repo_driver.py [-h] [--ab_testing] [--base_commit BASE_COMMIT]
                      [--branch BRANCH] [--commit COMMIT]
                      [--commit_file COMMIT_FILE] --exec_dir EXEC_DIR
                      --framework {caffe2,oculus,generic,tflite}
                      [--frameworks_dir FRAMEWORKS_DIR] [--interval INTERVAL]
                      --platforms PLATFORMS [--regression]
                      [--remote_repository REMOTE_REPOSITORY]
                      [--repo {git,hg}] --repo_dir REPO_DIR [--same_host]
                      [--status_file STATUS_FILE] [--step STEP]

Perform one benchmark run

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --ab_testing          Enable A/B testing in benchmark.
  --base_commit BASE_COMMIT
                        In A/B testing, this is the control commit that is
                        used to compare against. If not specified, the default
                        is the first commit in the week in UTC timezone. Even
                        if specified, the control is the later of the
                        specified commit and the commit at the start of the
                        week.
  --branch BRANCH       The remote repository branch. Defaults to master
  --commit COMMIT       The commit this benchmark runs on. It can be a branch.
                        Defaults to master. If it is a commit hash, and
                        program runs on continuous mode, it is the starting
                        commit hash the regression runs on. The regression
                        runs on all commits starting from the specified
                        commit.
  --commit_file COMMIT_FILE
                        The file saves the last commit hash that the
                        regression has finished. If this argument is specified
                        and is valid, the --commit has no use.
  --exec_dir EXEC_DIR   The executable is saved in the specified directory. If
                        an executable is found for a commit, no re-compilation
                        is performed. Instead, the previous compiled
                        executable is reused.
  --framework {caffe2,oculus,generic,tflite}
                        Specify the framework to benchmark on.
  --frameworks_dir FRAMEWORKS_DIR
                        Required. The root directory that all frameworks

                        specifications/frameworksdirectory.
  --interval INTERVAL   The minimum time interval in seconds between two
                        benchmark runs.
  --platforms PLATFORMS
                        Specify the platforms to benchmark on, in comma
                        separated list.Use this flag if the framework needs
                        special compilation scripts. The scripts are called
                        build.sh saved in
                        specifications/frameworks/<framework>/<platforms>
                        directory
  --regression          Indicate whether this run detects regression.
  --remote_repository REMOTE_REPOSITORY
                        The remote repository. Defaults to origin
  --repo {git,hg}       Specify the source control repo of the framework.
  --repo_dir REPO_DIR   Required. The base framework repo directory used for
                        benchmark.
  --same_host           Specify whether the build and benchmark run are on the
                        same host. If so, the build cannot be done in parallel
                        with the benchmark run.
  --status_file STATUS_FILE
                        A file to inform the driver stops running when the
                        content of the file is 0.
  --step STEP           Specify the number of commits we want to run the
                        benchmark once under continuous mode.
```

The `repo_driver.py` can also take the arguments that are recognized by `harness.py`. The arguments are passed over.
